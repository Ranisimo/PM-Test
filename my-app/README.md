Technical Task


CSS
I would've preferred to set up SASS styles to declutter the globals.css file, but instead I resorted to creating new hyphenated classes and applying them to the different elements. Using SASS to computerise the other reused and commonly used styles would've been far more scalable and further condensed the required classes. If given more time, I would use Bootstrap-React and SASS to be more efficient.

Components
There are a couple of cases where creating separate, reusable components for the different elements would've been beneficial. However, given the time constraints to return a completed static page from the Figma designs, I decided to go ahead with the solution I completed in this repo. As well, when looking across the different pages/navigation options, there wasn't a massive amount of components that I could've reused, such as the various banners, which are quite complex across the other pages and at least in this task, weren't something I wanted to spend time on doing, considering only the Home Page was requested.
